# Ask GPT-3.5:What are the first a few steps executed after execve() of a ELF dynamic link binary?
After the execve() system call is executed for an ELF dynamic link binary, the following steps are typically performed:

1. The kernel loads the executable file into memory.

When the execve() system call is executed, the kernel loads the binary into memory. This involves reading the contents of the binary from disk and copying them into memory. The kernel also sets up the program's memory space, including the stack and heap.

2. The kernel initializes the program counter (PC) to the entry point of the program.

The program counter (PC) is a register that keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be executed. When the kernel loads the binary into memory, it sets the PC to the entry point of the program, which is specified in the binary's ELF header.

3. The dynamic linker, ld.so, is invoked to load the shared libraries required by the program.

The dynamic linker, ld.so, is responsible for loading the shared libraries required by the program. When the program is loaded into memory, ld.so is invoked to load the shared libraries. The dynamic linker uses the program's ELF header to determine which shared libraries are required and where they are located.

4. The dynamic linker resolves the symbols in the program and shared libraries, linking them to their corresponding addresses in memory.

After the shared libraries are loaded, the dynamic linker resolves the symbols in the program and shared libraries. Symbols are names of functions, variables, or other objects that are used by the program. The dynamic linker links the symbols to their corresponding addresses in memory.

5. The dynamic linker sets up the global offset table (GOT) and procedure linkage table (PLT) for the program and shared libraries.

The global offset table (GOT) and procedure linkage table (PLT) are data structures used by the dynamic linker to resolve symbols at runtime. The dynamic linker sets up the GOT and PLT for the program and shared libraries.

6. The dynamic linker initializes any static variables in the program and shared libraries.

Static variables are variables that are allocated at compile-time and retain their values throughout the lifetime of the program. The dynamic linker initializes any static variables in the program and shared libraries.

7. The program's main function is called, and the program begins executing.

Finally, the program's main function is called, and the program begins executing. The program can now use the functions and variables provided by the shared libraries, which have been linked to their corresponding addresses in memory.
